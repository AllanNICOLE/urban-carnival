# urban-carnival


POC repository to play with Azure Cosmos DB. 

Ideas :
* Possibility to create and persist a collection of data (primary types first) in one "document". 
* When document is created, possibility to use it as model to create another documents. 
* Access via consoleApp, WepApi, WebApp (dotnet core, blazor, uwp maybe ?) 
* Get data with a unique identifer (guid), with public or private visibility
 

Personal goal : 
* Just develop 4 fun. 

Disclamer : It's a PROOF OF CONCEPT ! I know that the architecture is very simple and contain a lot of bulleshits. But to be honest, I don't care ;). 

In worklife, my code is ... a little bit better (Laurent, if you read this, shut up please :D).
